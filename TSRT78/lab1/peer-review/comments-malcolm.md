# Introduction

- Short introduction
- Unfinished sentence: "The lab contains three different parts". Which parts?

# Part 1 - Whistle

- Formatting of "kHz"

## Tasks and implementation

- Above equation 3:
    - Formatting mistake: "Hdist"
    - "... which is simply the ratio of energy outside the dominating frequency...", and what?
- Last part:
    - Explain why these methods work?

## Results

- The plot of the AR-order validation is not shown
- Presents results of questions 1, 2, 3, 4.
- No motivation of why the AR(2) model is good
- No answer to question 5
- Barely any discussion of the results

# Vowel

- Again, formatting mistake of "kHz"

## Tasks and implementation

- Aren't you describing the same validation twice? 
In both cases you test whiteness of the residual.

## Results

- What is Figure 6 a plot of? What is k?
- No selection of model order
- No simulation of the vowels
- No discussion
- Why put equation 4 there and not reference it?

# Speech

## Results

- All questions are answered
- Barely any discussion

# Overall comments

## Positive

- Easy to read for the most part
- All plots have graded axes, titles and captions
- Matlab code is readable and well commented
- Figures and equations (mostly) are referenced in the text.
- Content and conclusions are factually correct

## Negative

- Formatting, spelling and grammatical mistakes are common, proof reading is necessary
- Barely any discussion of the results
- Some important results from the study are missing
- Theory of the methods used is lacking
- Results are only reproducible if the MATLAB-code is read

## Conclusion

The report is easy to read and understand, and the MATLAB code is nicely structured and
readable. However, to improve the report the missing results from Whistle and Vowel
need to be presented, and the theory behind the methods be explained. Also, the meaning
of the results should be discussed, and the report needs to be proof read in order
to avoid formatting, spelling and grammatical mistakes.
